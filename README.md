# Blood Bowl Action Calculator

This repository contains a Python library to calculate the probability of a sequence of actions
in the board game "Blood Bowl". It is currently very bare bones. Expect development to be
sporadic bordering on non-existant. Feel free to send pull requests if you feel like
adding features!
