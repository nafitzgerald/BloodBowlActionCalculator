# Blood Bowl Action Calculator

This repository contains a Python library to calculate the probability of a sequence of actions
in the board game "Blood Bowl". It is currently very bare bones. Expect development to be
sporadic bordering on non-existant. Feel free to send pull requests if you feel like
adding features!

## Usage

Right now the main method is set up to calculate a specific scenario described in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodbowl/comments/4igekz/analysis_of_optimal_strategy_in_a_somewhat_common/).

Usage is:

    python main.py

In future I might add more flexible funtionality to allow specifying action sequences from commandline.

I release this code to the public domain. Do what you want with it.
